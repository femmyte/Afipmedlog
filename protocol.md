The health protocol definition is for a health record protocol. It defines various types of data related to a patient's health record, such as patient information, medical history, vital signs, medication information, immunization history, lab test results, diagnosis and treatment information, healthcare provider information, appointment and visit history, insurance information, and emergency contact information.

Each type of data has a corresponding schema and data formats. The schema provides a definition of the data structure, and the data formats specify the acceptable formats for the data.

The structure section defines the permissions for each type of data. Each data type has a set of actions that define who can read or write the data. The actions are defined using the "who" keyword, which specifies the role (e.g., author, recipient, anyone) and the "of" keyword, which specifies the parent object (e.g., patientInfo).

For example, in the "patientInfo" section, anyone can write the patient information, and the recipient of the patient information can read it. In the "guardianInfo" section, the recipient and author of the patient information can read it, and the author can also write it.

These permissions ensure that only authorized parties can access and modify specific types of health record data.
